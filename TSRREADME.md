Welcome to The Silk Route App 

This project combines Spring boot, hibernate, Oracle RDBMS and spring security to create an environment for artist, developers and other entrepreneurs to buy, sell and trade services. 


1. Start by loading the application as a spring project.

2. Login with an already created user, with the credentials = "sam@gmail.com", "Password".
(this password is stored as a bcrypt, encrpyted password.) or you may register a new user.

3. You may then search the market for a product and add that to your cart. 


4. Once you have selected your items from the market you may then proceed to checkout. 

5. Checkout is currently limited as I am adding in Stripe payment for secure payment methods.
